## I'm looking for
Early stage SaaS startups that gives preference in the order - **Employee > Customer > Company**

I stongly believe what Richard Branson says:
"Train people well enough so they can leave, treat them well enough so they don't want to"

Because gratitude is an inherent trait for most humans and when they are treated well, 
they are inclined to pass the good to their customers.
